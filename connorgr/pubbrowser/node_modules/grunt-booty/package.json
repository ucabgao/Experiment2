  "readme": "# grunt-booty\n\n> Adds the bootstrap to your project from a bower install - (optionally includes font-awesome)\n\n## Getting Started\nThis plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`\n\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-booty --save-dev\n```\n\nOne the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-booty');\n```\n\n## The \"booty\" task\n\n### Overview\nIn your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `booty` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`, it's a\nmultitask so you'll need to add a task identier (e.g. `dev`):\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  booty: {\n    dev: {\n      options: {\n        componentPath: '/path/to/bower/components/',\n        dest: '/path/to/styles/directory/'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n### Options\n\n#### options.componentPath\nThe location of the bower installs\n\n#### options.dest\nThe stylesheet destination for all of the bootstrap and font-awesome goodness\n\n### Usage Examples\nThe plugin is designed to be able to be integrated easily into a number of projects although the initial use case is\nto include bootstrap and font-awesome-more into a yeoman angular scaffold ( _using yeoman 1.0_ ).  These are the\nsteps to do that:\n\n* Make sure __yeoman__, __bower__, __grunt__ and the __angular generator__ are installed ( _[more info](http://yeoman.io/)_ )\n  ```bash\n  npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower\n  npm install -g generator-angular generator-karma\n  ```\n\n* Create a new directory and scaffold the project with yeoman.  Yeoman will ask for a number of setup options, just\nhit `n` for everything ( _you can add the additional angular stuff if you need but no need for the Compass version of\nbootstrap_ )\n  ```bash\n  mkdir bootilicious && cd $_\n  yo angular\n  ```\n\n* Install the components we want from __bower__ and install the __grunt__ tasks we need to work with them\n  ```bash\n  bower install bootstrap font-awesome-more --save\n  npm install grunt-booty grunt-contrib-less --save-dev\n  ```\n\n* Everything will be installed and ready to go but there is a quick bit of scaffolding before we can set up the tasks\nto run - go ahead and create a `css` and a `less` folder in `styles`, we can also delete the pre-generated `main.css`\nas we’ll be using a slightly different structure ( _grunt-booty will very soon take care of this step for you_ )\n  ```bash\n  mkdir -p app/styles/{css,less}\n  rm app/styles/main.css\n  ```\n\n* Create `main.less` in `app/styles/less` and add these lines to import __bootstrap__ and __font-awesome-more__ ( _if\nyou want the extras in font-awesome-more then import them here_ ):\n  ```bash\n  vi app/styles/less/main.less\n  ```\n  ```less\n  @import './../bootstrap/bootstrap';\n  @import './../bootstrap/responsive';\n  @import './../font-awesome-more/font-awesome';\n  ```\n\n* While we’re house keeping we should also update the link to the `main.css` file that will be created when the task\nis run.  Replace line 14 in `index.html` with this ( _adds the css folder to the path for the css_ ):\n  ```html\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles/css/main.css\">\n  ```\n\n* Now it’s time to set up the tasks.  Add these tasks to your `Gruntfile.initConfig` object:\n  ```js\n  booty: {\n    dev: {\n      options: {\n        componentPath: '<%= yeoman.app %>/components/',\n        dest: '<%= yeoman.app %>/styles/'\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  less: {\n    dev: {\n      options: {\n        paths: ['<%= yeoman.app %>/styles/less/']\n      },\n      files: {\n        '<%= yeoman.app %>/styles/css/main.css': '<%= yeoman.app %>/styles/less/main.less'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n  ( _Booty is a one-time assembly task—unless you’re reassembling bootstrap and font-awesome-more after an update—but\n  you'll probably want to compile your less more than once so you'll probably want to add the less task to the server\n  task that is scaffolded from yeoman and additionally add your less to the watch task_ )\n\n* Everything should be ready to rock so hit up your tasks\n  ```bash\n  grunt booty\n  grunt less\n  ```\n\n* Now fire up the server to see the yeoman generated index page, complete with bootstrappy goodness\n  ```bash\n  grunt server\n  ```\n\n* To test that font-awesome-more has been also been included in your project go ahead and open up a new bash tab to\nkeep the watch task running and replace line 2 in `app/views/main.html` with this:\n  ```bash\n  vi app/views/main.html\n  ```\n  ```html\n  <h1><i class=\"icon-github icon-large\"></i> 'Allo, 'Allo!</h1>\n  ```\n\n* Now get to work creating awesome things\n\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.
