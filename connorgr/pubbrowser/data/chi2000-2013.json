Users have scarce information about who actually sees their content, making their audience seem invisible and difficult to estimate. However, understanding this invisible audience can impact both science and design, since perceived audiences influence content production and self-presentation online. In this paper, we combine survey and large-scale log data to examine how well users' perceptions of their audience match their actual audience on Facebook. We find that social media users consistently underestimate their audience size for their posts, guessing that their audience is just 27% of its true size. Qualitative coding of survey responses reveals folk theories that attempt to reverse-engineer audience size using feedback and friend count, though none of these approaches are particularly accurate. We analyze audience logs for 222,000 Facebook users' posts over the course of one month and find that publicly visible signals --- friend count, likes, and comments --- vary widely and do not strongly indicate the audience of a single post. Despite the variation, users typically reach 61% of their friends each month. Together, our results begin to reveal the invisible undercurrents of audience attention and behavior in online social networks.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2470658&ftid=1367069&dwn=1&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2470654.2470658", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2470658&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81436603273&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "name": "Brian Karrer"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Papers: managing social media", "doi": "10.1145/2470654.2470659", "title": "Gender, topic, and audience response: an analysis of user-generated content on facebook", "abstract": "Although both men and women communicate frequently on Facebook, we know little about what they talk about, whether their topics differ and how their network responds.

Our hypothesis is that this illusionary effect in weight perception can be applied to reduce fatigue while handling medium-weight objects without mechatronics-based physical assistance. In this paper, we propose an augmented reality system that changes the brightness value of an object in order to reduce fatigue while handling the object.

We conclude firstly that this paradigm provides a good basis for the future evaluation of memory-based authentication systems and secondly that age-appropriate face-based authentication is viable in the security marketplace.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2470701&ftid=1367104&dwn=1&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2470654.2470701", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2470701&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81100277550&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "name": "Pam Briggs"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Papers: technologies for life 1", "doi": "10.1145/2470654.2470702", "title": "The presentation of health-related search results and its impact on negative emotional outcomes", "abstract": "Searching for health information online has become increasingly common, yet few studies have examined potential negative emotional effects of online health information search.

In a series of user studies, we validate the effectiveness of the TapBoard concept.

ExposeHK's four key design goals are: 1) enable users to browse hotkeys; 2) allow non-expert users to issue hotkey commands as a physical rehearsal of expert performance; 3) exploit spatial memory to assist non-expert users in identifying hotkeys; and 4) maximise expert performance by using consistent shortcuts in a flat command hierarchy. ExposeHK supports these objectives by displaying hotkeys overlaid on their associated commands when a modifier key is pressed. We evaluated ExposeHK in three empirical studies using toolbars, menus, and a tabbed \\'18ribbon' toolbar. Results show that participants used more hotkeys, and used them more often, with ExposeHK than with other techniques; they were faster with ExposeHK than with either pointing or other hotkey methods; and they strongly preferred ExposeHK.

We conducted an interview study that focuses on the existing routines of families and how they currently understand their power and gas consumption based on standard utility bills.

This allowed us to assess calendars as an artifact for energy consumption awareness. Our results show that many people relate changes in energy consumption to high-level effects such as weather and temperature and not necessarily their own everyday activities. Events on calendars may aid this understanding but people do not currently record enough information on their calendars to make a strong tie.

Our study reveals that, by using HEMS, participants became increasingly literate in understanding domestic electricity consumption.

Based on preliminary findings that identified a novel digital ideation paradigm we refer to as chainstorming, or online communication brainstorming, two exploratory studies were performed. First, we developed and tested a distributed method of ideation we call cheatstorming, in which previously generated brainstorm ideas are delivered to targeted local contexts in response to a prompt. We then performed a more rigorous case study to examine the cheatstorming method and consider its possible implementation in the context of a distributed online ideation tool. Based on observations from these studies, we conclude with the somewhat provocative suggestion that ideation need not require the generation of new ideas. Rather, we present a model of ideation suggesting that its value has less to do with the generation of novel ideas than the cultural influence exerted by unconventional ideas on the ideating team. Thus brainstorming is more than the pooling of \"invented\" ideas, it involves the sharing and interpretation of concepts in unintended and (ideally) unanticipated ways.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2466177&ftid=1366823&dwn=1&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2470654.2466177", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2466177&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81361595438&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "name": "Evan Sheehan"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Papers: ideation methods", "doi": "10.1145/2470654.2466178", "title": "Fashionable shape switching: explorations in outfit-centric design", "abstract": "We present a design exercise illustrating how fashion practices and the fashion design process can be used to create new opportunities both in the mobile domain and in product design, as well as in wearable computing.

Assuming devices are pre-configured for a unique, device-specific network name and passphrase, MultiNet constructs an out-of-band visual channel via an intermediary network controller device to convey the device's configuration to the network.

The input type and the resulting embodiment dramatically influence tabletop interaction: in particular, the touch avoidance that naturally governs people's touching and crossing behavior with physical arms is lost with digital embodiments. One result of this loss is that people are less aware of each others' arms, and less able to coordinate actions and protect personal territories. To determine whether there are strategies that can influence group interaction on shared digital tabletops, we studied augmented digital arm embodiments that provide tactile feedback or movement alterations when people touched or crossed arms. The study showed that both augmentation types changed people's behavior (people crossed less than half as often) and also changed their perception (people felt more aware of the other person's arm, and felt more awkward when touching).

We propose a new account of coherence in a mixed interaction system that integrates externalization mechanisms. We found that physical objects play two roles: they act both as representation of mental objects and as tangible artifacts for interacting with augmented features. We observed that virtual objects represent physical ones, and not the reverse, and, being virtual representations of physical objects, should seamlessly converge with the cognitive role of the physical object.

However, it lacks the ability to alter the pitch of a note after it has been played, a limitation which prevents the performer from executing common expressive techniques including vibrato and pitch bending. We present a system for controlling pitch from the keyboard surface using capacitive touch sensors to measure the locations of the player's fingers on the keys. The large community of trained pianists makes the keyboard a compelling target for augmentation, but it also poses a challenge: how can a musical interface be extended while making use of the existing techniques performers have spent thousands of hours learning? In this paper, user studies with conservatory pianists explore the constraints of traditional keyboard technique and evaluate the usability of the continuous pitch control system. The paper also discusses implications for the extension of other established interfaces in musical and non-musical contexts.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2481302&ftid=1368385&dwn=1&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2470654.2481302", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2481302&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81335497880&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "name": "Adam M.

While the scope of temporal query is very broad, this work focuses on two particularly complex and critical facets of temporal event sequences: intervals (events with both a start time and an end time), and the absence of an event. We describe how users encounter a common set of difficulties when specifying such queries, and propose solutions to help overcome them. Finally, we report on two case studies with epidemiologists at the US Army Pharmacovigilance Center, illustrating how both query interfaces were used to study patterns of drug use.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2481325&ftid=1368406&dwn=1&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2470654.2481325", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2481325&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81557696656&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "name": "Jeff Millstein"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Papers: data navigation", "doi": "10.1145/2470654.2481326", "title": "Beyond the filter bubble: interactive effects of perceived threat and topic involvement on selective exposure to information", "abstract": "We investigated participants' preferential selection of information and their attitude moderation in an online environment.

Participants had a higher tendency to select peer user opinions in topics that they had low than high involvement, but only when there was no perception of threat. Overall, participants' attitudes were moderated after being exposed to diverse views, although high topic involvement led to higher resistance to such moderation.

In safety-critical environments such as air traffic control or on hospital wards, incorrect number entry can have serious harmful consequences. Research has investigated how interface designs can help prevent users from making number entry errors. In this paper, we present an experimental evaluation of two possible interface designs aimed at helping users detect number entry errors using the idea of a checksum: an additional (redundant) number that is related to the to-be-entered numbers in such a way that it is sufficient to verify the correctness of the checksum, as opposed to checking each of the entered numbers. The first interface requires users to check their own work with the help of the checksum; the second requires the user to enter the checksum along with the other numbers so that the system can do the checking. In each case, two numbers needed to be entered, while the third number served as a checksum. With the first interface, users caught only 36% of their errors. The second interface resulted in all errors being caught, but the need to enter the checksum increased entry time by 46%. When participants were allowed to choose between the two interfaces, they chose the second interface in only 12% of the cases. Although these results cannot be generalized to other specific contexts, the results illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each way of using checksums to catch number entry errors. Hence our study can serve as a starting point for efforts to improve each method.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2481332&ftid=1368412&dwn=1&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2470654.2481332", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2481332&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81558118856&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "name": "Sarah O'Carroll"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Papers: social tagging", "doi": "10.1145/2470654.2481334", "title": "All the news that's fit to read: a study of social annotations for news reading", "abstract": "As news reading becomes more social, how do different types of annotations affect people's selection of news articles?

The second experiment simulates a logged-in experience with annotations from friends, finding that friend annotations are both persuasive and improve user satisfaction over their article selections. In post-experiment interviews, we found that this increased satisfaction is due partly because of the context that annotations add.

As an attempt to resolve these weaknesses, we conducted a large-scale survey of 642 gamers' eating habits and their associated determinants of healthy behavior to understand how health behavior relates to gamer type. We developed seven different models of healthy eating behavior for the gamer types identified by BrainHex.

We consider three factors that are often studied in desktop settings the ad's level of personal relevance to the user, its relevance to the page content, and within-ad properties, with a particular focus on the level of animation in the ad. Our findings reveal a few surprises. First, personal relevance to the user has little or no impact on ad efficacy measured by recall. Instead, content relevance boosts ad recall. Second, user relevance leads to a more pleasant and interesting experience, but content relevance has no effect. Third, contrary to the popular notion that animation often leads to more effective ads by garnering more user attention, we find that a simple type of animation, such as blinking animation, negatively affects user experience and reduces ad recall.

The key idea behind LaserOrigami is that it achieves three-dimensionality by folding and stretching the workpiece, rather than by placing joints, thereby eliminating the need for manual assembly. LaserOrigami achieves this by heating up selected regions of the workpiece until they become compliant and bend down under the force of gravity. LaserOrigami administers the heat by defocusing the laser, which distributes the laser's power across a larger surface. LaserOrigami implements cutting and bending in a single integrated process by automatically moving the cutting table up and down--when users take out the workpiece, it is already fully assembled.

In contrast, augmenting on-screen visualizations with stereoscopic rendering alone or with prop-based manipulation was of limited help.

Spatial consistency allows users to develop memory of object locations, reducing the time needed for visual search, and because spatial memory is long lasting and has a large capacity these performance benefits are enduring and scalable. This suggests that spatial consistency could be used as a fundamental principle for the design of interfaces. However, there are many display situations where the standard presentation is altered in some way: e.g., a window is moved to a new location, scaled, or rotated on a mobile or tabletop display. It is not known whether the benefits of spatial organization are robust to these common kinds of view transformation. To assess these effects, we tested user performance with a spatial interface that had been transformed in several ways, including different degrees of translation, rotation, scaling, and perspective change. We found that performance was not strongly affected by the changes, except in the case of large rotations. To demonstrate the value of spatial consistency over existing mechanisms for dealing with view changes, we compared user performance with a spatially-stable presentation (using scaling) with that of a 'reflowing' presentation (widely used in current interfaces). This study showed that spatial stability with scaling dramatically outperforms reflowing. This research provides new evidence of spatial consistency's value in interface design: it is robust to the view transformations that occur in typical environments, and it provides substantial performance advantages over traditional methods.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2466430&ftid=1367026&dwn=1&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2470654.2466430", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2466430&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81414620309&CFID=338097500&CFTOKEN=80739709", "name": "Sylvain Malacria"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Papers: spatial interfaces", "doi": "10.1145/2470654.2466431", "title": "Canyon: providing location awareness of multiple moving objects in a detail view on large displays", "abstract": "Overview+Detail interfaces can be used to examine the details of complex data while retaining the data's overall context.

There is a need for novel therapies and interventions that can help children with ASDs develop the social skills necessary to live independently. Since the launch of the iPad, there has been a great deal of excitement in the autism community about multitouch tablets and their possible use in interventions. There are hundreds of apps listed as possibly helping children with ASDs, yet there is little empirical evidence that any of them have positive effects. In this paper we present a study on the use of a set of apps from Open Autism Software at an afterschool program for children with ASDs. The apps are designed to naturally encourage positive social interactions through creative, expressive, and collaborative activities. The study compared activities conducted with the apps to similar activities conducted without the apps. We video recorded the activities, and coded children's behavior. We found that during the study children spoke more sentences, had more verbal interactions, and were more physically engaged with the activities when using the apps. We also found that children made more supportive comments during activities conducted with two of the apps.

Well-designed glyphs have several benefits: they (1) require less screen space and layout effort, (2) are easier to understand in the context of the network, (3) can reveal otherwise hidden relationships, and (4) preserve as much underlying information as possible.

This paper proposes that the value of digital objects may inhere less in an object's identity as a particular item and more in the object's ability to provide access to an intellectual work. The work, a familiar concept in information studies and textual studies, designates a general product of intellectual creation that may be instantiated in many versions.

It encourages people to do things at the right time and at the right speed which helps them to understand and reflect on their actions. Several authors have proposed Slow Design principles and cases have been reported in which these principles were applied in cultural design projects. These applications indicated that Slow Design can indeed have a positive impact on wellbeing. Although promising, this philosophy has not yet been used in the design of mass consumer products.

Two studies are reported on where the conditions for implementing Slow Design are explored. The results led to a revision of the principles for use by product designers. The main finding from the case study is that the Slow Design principles can be used to create more 'mindful' interactions that stimulate positive user involvement.

This paper presents CueFlik, a Web image search application that allows end users to quickly create their own rules for re ranking images based on their visual characteristics. End users can then re rank any future Web image search results according to their rule. In an experiment we present in this paper, end users quickly create effective rules for such concepts as \"product photos\", \"portraits of people\", and \"clipart\".

The results often contain a large number of outliers, since these outliers may be similar to the query image in some way. In this paper we present a novel search scheme using query images from multiple classes. Instead of conducting query search for one image class at a time, we conduct multi-class query search jointly. By using several query classes that are similar to each other for multi-class query, we can utilize information across similar classes to fine tune the similarity measure to remove outliers.

If done during early stage design, it can mute creative ideas that do not conform to current interface norms. If done to test radical innovations, the many interface issues that would likely arise from an immature technology can quash what could have been an inspired vision. If done to validate an academic prototype, it may incorrectly suggest a design's scientific worthiness rather than offer a meaningful critique of how it would be adopted and used in everyday practice.

This paper discusses our work in developing a museum guide robot that moves its head at interactionally significant points during its explanation of an exhibit. In order to proceed, we first examined the coordination of verbal and non-verbal actions in human guide-visitor interaction. Based on this analysis, we developed a robot that moves its head at interactionally significant points in its talk. We then conducted several experiments to examine human participant non-verbal responses to the robot's head and gaze turns. Our results show that participants are likely to display non-verbal actions, and do so with precision timing, when the robot turns its head and gaze at interactionally significant points than when the robot turns its head at not interactionally significant points.

Second, device use varies by user and circumstance; users assign different roles to devices both by choice and by constraint. Third, users in industry want to separate work and personal activities across work and personal devices, but they have difficulty doing so in practice Finally, users employ a variety of techniques for accessing information across devices, but there is room for improvement: participants reported managing information across their devices as the most challenging aspect of using multiple devices.

The company commissioning the evaluation, however, assesses those problems 30-42% higher on four dimensions of utility. We discuss how the findings may generalize to usability professionals, and how the technique may be used in realistic usability evaluations.

These list-of-rules interfaces cause problems for users when multiple rules interact, because the interfaces have no means of conveying the interactions amongst rules to users. Instead, users are left to figure out these rule interactions themselves. An Expandable Grid is an interactive matrix visualization designed to address the problems that list-of-rules interfaces have in conveying policies to users.

Our findings suggest that despite the structured nature of lists, our users socialize more around lists than photos, and use lists as a medium for self-representation.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1357296&ftid=499595&dwn=1&CFID=338110225&CFTOKEN=27880784", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1357054.1357296", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1357296&CFID=338110225&CFTOKEN=27880784", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81332517372&CFID=338110225&CFTOKEN=27880784", "name": "Michael Muller"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Tactile and Haptic User Interfaces", "doi": "10.1145/1357054.1357298", "title": "Emotional and behavioral responses to haptic stimulation", "abstract": "A prototype of friction-based horizontally rotating fingertip stimulator was used to investigate emotional experiences and behavioral responses to haptic stimulation. The rotation style of 12 different stimuli was varied by burst length (i.e., 20, 50, 100 ms), continuity (i.e., continuous and discontinuous), and direction (e.g., forward and backward). Using these stimuli 528 stimulus pairs were presented to 12 subjects who were to distinguish if stimuli in each pair were the same or different. Then they rated the stimuli using four scales measuring the pleasantness, arousal, approachability, and dominance qualities of the 12 stimuli. The results showed that continuous forward-backward rotating stimuli were rated as significantly more unpleasant, arousing, avoidable, and dominating than other types of stimulations (e.g., discontinuous forward rotation). The reaction times to these stimuli were significantly faster than reaction times to discontinuous forward and backward rotating stimuli. The results clearly suggest that even simple haptic stimulation can carry emotional information.

We ran an experiment to compare devices with a physical keyboard, a standard touchscreen and a touchscreen with tactile feedback added. We tested this in both static and mobile environments. The results showed that the addition of tactile feedback to the touchscreen significantly improved finger-based text entry, bringing it close to the performance of a real physical keyboard.

Using a dataset collected from a broadly popular social network site, we analyze users' profiles, 340,000 online friendships and 200,000 interpersonal messages. Using social capital theory, we predict differences between rural and urban users and find strong evidence supporting our hypotheses. Namely, rural people articulate far fewer friends online, and those friends live much closer to home.

Our results indicate that the model accurately accounts for peephole pointing for a variety of display sizes, both with and without users' having prior knowledge of the target location.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1357320&ftid=499613&dwn=1&CFID=338110225&CFTOKEN=27880784", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1357054.1357320", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1357320&CFID=338110225&CFTOKEN=27880784", "authors": [], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Pointing and Flicking", "doi": "10.1145/1357054.1357321", "title": "The effect of spring stiffness and control gain with an elastic rate control pointing device", "abstract": "Isometric and elastic devices are most compatible with a rate control mapping.

The results reveal a U-shaped profile of control gain vs. movement time, with different profiles for different stiffness levels. Using the optimum control gain for each stiffness level, performance across stiffness levels were similar. However, users preferred lower stiffness and lower control gain levels due to increased controller displacement.

We used ethnographic and usability methods to understand how tablets would be integrated into household activities and to define user requirements for such devices. Participants viewed the tablet as conceptually different from a PC. The tablet enabled a high degree of multitasking with household activities, yet flaws in form and function affected use. Results suggest that correctly designed portable Internet appliances will fill a special role in peoples' daily lives, particularly if these devices share information with each other.

The model includes a movement component based on Fitts' law and a linguistic component based on digraph, or letter-pair, probabilities. Predictions are provided for one-handed thumb and two-handed index finger input. For the traditional multi-press method or the lesser-used two-key method, predicted expert rates vary from about 21 to 27 words per minute (wpm). The relatively new T9 method works with a disambiguating algorithm and inputs each character with a single key press. Predicted expert rates vary from 41 wpm for one-handed thumb input to 46 wpm for two-handed index finger input. These figures are degraded somewhat depending on the user's strategy in coping with less-than-perfect disambiguation.

The GUIDE system has been built to overcome many of the limitations of the traditional information and navigation tools available to city visitors. For example, group-based tours are inherently inflexible with fixed starting times and fixed durations and (like most guidebooks) are constrained by the need to satisfy the interests of the majority rather than the specific interests of individuals. Following a period of requirements capture, involving experts in the field of tourism, we developed and installed a system for use by visitors to Lancaster.

Furthermore, different styles of slide-authoring (e.g., detailed vs. big-points only) can have a big impact on their effectiveness as summaries, raising a dilemma for some speakers in authoring for on-demand previewing versus that for live audiences.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=332427&ftid=2829&dwn=1&CFID=338110224&CFTOKEN=22018681", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/332040.332427", "href": "citation.cfm?id=332427&CFID=338110224&CFTOKEN=22018681", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81100031531&CFID=338110224&CFTOKEN=22018681", "name": "Jonathan Grudin"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "", "doi": "10.1145/332040.332428", "title": "An interactive comic book presentation for exploring video", "abstract": "This paper presents a method for generating compact pictorial summarizations of video.

A Fitts tapping task is used to assess the effect of both contact with virtual objects and real-time update of the centre of perspective based on the user's actual eye position. A Polhemus tracker is used to measure the user's head position and from this estimate their eye position. In half of the conditions, head tracked perspective is employed so that visual feedback is accurate while in the other half a fixed eye-position is assumed. A Phantom force feedback device is used to make it possible to touch the targets in selected conditions. Subjects were required to change their viewing position periodically to assess the importance of correct perspective and of touching the targets in maintaining eye-hand co-ordination, The results show that accurate perspective improves performance by an average of 9% and contact improves it a further 12%.

Ten adults performed eighty steering tasks, where the participants moved the cursor through a small tunnel with varying indices of difficulty using a conventional and force-feedback mouse. For the force-feedback condition, the mouse displayed force that pulled the cursor to the center of the tunnel. The tasks required both horizontal and vertical screen movements of the cursor. Movement times were on average 52 percent faster during the force-feedback condition when compared to the conventional mouse. Furthermore, for the conventional mouse vertical movements required more time to complete than horizontal screen movements. Another ten adults completed a combined steering and targeting task, where the participants navigated through a tunnel and then clicked a small box at the end of the tunnel.

In the current work, we assimilate previous empirical studies which compare interfaces with visually embodied agents to interfaces without agents, both using an informal, descriptive technique based on experimental results (46 studies) as well as a formal statistical meta-analysis (25 studies). Results revealed significantly larger effect sizes when analyzing subjective responses (i.e., questionnaire ratings, interviews) than when analyzing behavioral responses such as task performance and memory. Furthermore, the effects of adding an agent to an interface are larger than the effects of animating an agent to behave more realistically. However, the overall effect sizes were quite small (e.g., across studies, adding a face to an interface only explains approximately 2.5% of the variance in results). We discuss the implications for both designers building interfaces as well as social scientists designing experiments to evaluate those interfaces.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1240626&ftid=411286&dwn=1&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1240624.1240626", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1240626&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "authors": [], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Faces & bodies in interaction", "doi": "10.1145/1240624.1240627", "title": "Improving recognition and characterization in groupware with rich embodiments", "abstract": "Embodiments are visual representations of people in a groupware system.

Although MMOGs take face-to-face conversation as their metaphor for user-to-user interaction, avatars currently give off much less information about what users are doing than real human bodies. Consequently, users routinely encounter slippages in coordination when engaging in joint courses of action. In this study, we analyze screen-capture video of user-to-user interaction in the game, City of Heroes, under two conditions: one with the game's standard awareness cues and the other with enhanced cues. We use conversation analysis to demonstrate interactional slippages caused by the absence of awareness cues, user practices that circumvent such limitations and ways in which enhanced cues can enable tighter coordination.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1240628&ftid=411288&dwn=1&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1240624.1240628", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1240628&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "authors": [], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Presentations", "mp3Href": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2180991&ftid=1213203&dwn=1&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "doi": "10.1145/1240624.2180991", "title": "Web 2.0 and the Enterprise: The Business Impact of Modern Technological Approaches to Web Application Design", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1240624.2180991", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2180991&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "mp3": "Mp3 Audio only", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81501642518&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "name": "Jonathan Grubb"}]}, {"session": "Presentations", "doi": "10.1145/1240624.2180994", "title": "Faceted Metadata for Information Architecture and Search", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1240624.2180994", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2180994&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "authors": []}, {"session": "Presentations", "mp3Href": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2180996&ftid=1213216&dwn=1&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "doi": "10.1145/1240624.2180996", "title": "Industrial Design: Challenges and Successes Towards an integrated Product Development Process", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1240624.2180996", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2180996&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "mp3": "Mp3 Audio only", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81501646385&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "name": "Tim Wood"}]}, {"session": "Presentations", "mp3Href": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2180990&ftid=1213202&dwn=1&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "doi": "10.1145/1240624.2180990", "title": "Wednesday CHI Madness", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1240624.2180990", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2180990&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "mp3": "Mp3 Audio only", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81100137268&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "name": "Patrick Baudisch"}]}, {"session": "Presentations", "doi": "10.1145/1240624.2180969", "title": "Monday CHI Madness", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1240624.2180969", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2180969&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "authors": []}, {"session": "Presentations", "doi": "10.1145/1240624.2180965", "title": "Public Usability Laboratory", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1240624.2180965", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2180965&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "authors": []}, {"session": "Presentations", "doi": "10.1145/1240624.2180963", "title": "From Mice to Men -

Although OM is fallible, it may be more efficient than accessing information from a complex PM device. We report a controlled lab study which investigates when and why people use PM and OM. We found that PM use depended on users' evaluation of the quality of their OM, as well as PM device properties. In particular, we found that users trade-off Accuracy and Efficiency, preferring rapid access to potentially inaccurate information over laborious access to accurate information. We discuss the implications of these results for future PM design and theory.

The interface is based on a tabletop interaction surface that can sense and move small objects on top of it. The positions of these physical objects represent and control parameters inside a software application, such as a system for optimizing the configuration of radio towers in a cellular telephone network. The computer autonomously attempts to optimize the network, moving the objects on the table as it changes their corresponding parameters in software. As these objects move, the user can constrain their motion with his or her hands, or many other kinds of physical objects. The interface provides ample opportunities for improvisation by allowing the user to employ a rich variety of everyday physical objects as mechanical constraints. This approach leverages the user's mechanical intuition for how objects respond to physical forces. As well, it allows the user to balance the numerical optimization performed by the computer with other goals that are difficult to quantify.

Participants were able to easily use the combined surrogates even though they were not synchronized, suggesting that synchronization of different media channels may not be necessary in surrogates as it is in full video. The results suggest that multimodal surrogates should be incorporated into video retrieval user interfaces and audio surrogates should be used in small display interfaces. The study also raises questions about the need to synchronize different information channels in multimedia surrogates.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1240755&ftid=416086&dwn=1&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1240624.1240755", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1240755&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81100052406&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "name": "Gary Marchionini"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Video", "doi": "10.1145/1240624.1240756", "title": "Watching together: integrating text chat with video", "abstract": "Watching video online is becoming increasingly popular, and new video streaming technologies have the potential to transform video watching from a passive, isolating experience into an active, socially engaging experience.

Using standard web technologies, our HTTP proxy can record very detailed usage information, such as mouse movements, clicks, key presses and scrolling, together with the exact HTML DOM tree objects involved. As we show in several case studies, the tracking also works across multiple websites, none of which needs to be under our control. This approach is much less invasive than previous efforts: The test person does not need to install software on her computer, and in certain operation modes, no configuration changes at all are required on her computer.

The three remote methods are a remote synchronous condition, where testing is conducted in real time but the test monitor is separated spatially from the test subjects, and two remote asynchronous conditions, where the test monitor and the test subjects are separated both spatially and temporally. The results show that the remote synchronous method is virtually equivalent to the conventional method.

However, when the design's objective is to train users to interact with interfaces that are highly dependent on spatial properties (e.g. keypad layout or gesture shapes) we contend that designers should consider explicitly increasing the mental effort of interaction. To test the hypothesis that effort aids spatial memory, we designed a \"frost-brushing\" interface that forces the user to mentally retrieve spatial information, or to physically brush away the frost to obtain visual guidance. We report results from two experiments using virtual keypad interfaces -- the first concerns spatial location learning of buttons on the keypad, and the second concerns both location and trajectory learning of gesture shape. The results support our hypothesis, showing that the frost-brushing design improved spatial learning. The participants' subjective responses emphasised the connections between effort, engagement, boredom, frustration, and enjoyment, suggesting that effort requires careful parameterisation to maximise its effectiveness.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1240863&ftid=416497&dwn=1&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1240624.1240863", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1240863&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "authors": [], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Learning", "doi": "10.1145/1240624.1240864", "title": "Multiple mice for retention tasks in disadvantaged schools", "abstract": "This study evaluates single-mouse and multiple-mice configurations for computer-aided learning in schools where access to computers is limited due to resource constraints. \n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1240864&ftid=416498&dwn=1&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1240624.1240864", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1240864&CFID=338110220&CFTOKEN=64114180", "authors": [], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Learning", "doi": "10.1145/1240624.1240865", "title": "Strategies for accelerating on-line learning of hotkeys", "abstract": "Hotkeys are extremely useful in leveraging expert performance, but learning them is a slow process.

Our findings show that participants were able to quickly build sound mental models of the recommender system's reasoning, and that participants who most improved their mental models during the study were significantly more likely to make the recommender operate to their satisfaction.

Comparing a remote upper-arm touch against a similarly timed flashing light, we explore the importance of the touch modality in affect conveyance. Our second manipulation involves two cover stories where the listener is told that the touch or flashing light is triggered either by the storyteller expressively squeezing a touch input device while speaking, or by measured 'high points' in the mental state of the storyteller. Our results show that the story accompanied by communicative touch resulted in a significant increase in the sense of connectedness with the storyteller over the speech-only condition, and a trend toward greater affective conveyance.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2207697&ftid=1216849&dwn=1&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2207676.2207697", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2207697&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81100418633&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "name": "Adrian Cheok"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Touch in context", "doi": "10.1145/2207676.2207698", "title": "TAP & PLAY: an end-user toolkit for authoring interactive pen and paper language activities", "abstract": "Hybrid paper-digital interfaces are a promising approach for supporting language activities.

Errors in both stages could influence flicking accuracy. We investigated flicking interactions on curved interactive surface to evaluate which type of error influences accuracy. Therefore, we carried out three user studies to analyze how each stage of flicking on a curved surface is influenced. Our main findings are: 1) Flicking gestures are more accurate if horizontal and vertical surface are joined by a continuous curve than if they are separated by an edge or gap. 2) Flicking gestures on curved surfaces are mostly influenced by the motor execution stage of the gesture rather than the visual perception stage. 3) Flicking accuracy decreases as the starting point of the gesture is moved closer to the curve. 4) We conclude with a first mathematical model to estimate the error users will make when flicking across a curve.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2207703&ftid=1216856&dwn=1&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2207676.2207703", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2207703&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81100443423&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "name": "Jan Borchers"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Curves & mirages: gestures & interaction with nonplanar surfaces", "doi": "10.1145/2207676.2207704", "title": "MirageTable: freehand interaction on a projected augmented reality tabletop", "abstract": "Instrumented with a single depth camera, a stereoscopic projector, and a curved screen, \n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2207704&ftid=1216857&dwn=1&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2207676.2207704", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2207704&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81350567780&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "name": "Andrew Wilson"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Curves & mirages: gestures & interaction with nonplanar surfaces", "doi": "10.1145/2207676.2207705", "title": "How screen transitions influence touch and pointer interaction across angled display arrangements", "abstract": "Digital office environments often integrate multiple displays in a variety of arrangements.

We first show that ERN can be seen on signals captured by EEG headsets like Emotiv\u2122 when doing a typical multiple choice reaction time (RT) task -- Flanker task. We then present a single-trial online ERN algorithm that works by pre-computing the coefficient matrix of a logistic regression classifier using some data from a multiple choice reaction time task and uses it to classify incoming signals of that task on a single trial of data. We apply it to an interactive selection task that involved users selecting an object under time pressure. Furthermore the study was conducted in a typical office environment with ambient noise. Our results show that online single trial ERN detection is possible using off-the-shelf headsets during tasks that are typical of interactive applications. We then design a Superflick experiment with an integrated module mimicking an ERN detector to evaluate the accuracy of detecting ERN in the context of assisting users in interactive tasks.

By capturing both why people make these decisions and how Facebook's affordances support them, we expect our findings to generalize to many other social media tools and to inform theorizing about how these tools affect relational development.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2207788&ftid=1216944&dwn=1&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2207676.2207788", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2207788&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81502752595&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "name": "Dan Cosley"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Intimacy & connection", "doi": "10.1145/2207676.2207789", "title": "Lost in translation: understanding the possession of digital things in the cloud", "abstract": "People are amassing larger and more diverse collections of digital things.

In the second part, I discuss three possible interpretations for the diversity of approaches to research through design, and suggest that this variation need not be seen as a sign of inadequate standards or a lack of cumulative progress in the field, but may be natural for a generative endeavour. In the final section, I suggest that, rather than aiming to develop increasingly comprehensive theories of design, practice based research might better view theory as annotation of realised design examples, and particularly portfolios of related pieces. Overall, I suggest that the design research community should be wary of impulses towards convergence and standardisation, and instead take pride in its aptitude for exploring and speculating, particularising and diversifying, and - especially - its ability to manifest the results in the form of new, conceptually rich artefacts.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2208538&ftid=1217256&dwn=1&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2207676.2208538", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2208538&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81502746712&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "name": "William Gaver"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Critical perspectives on design", "doi": "10.1145/2207676.2208539", "title": "Sustainably unpersuaded: how persuasion narrows our vision of sustainability", "abstract": "In this paper we provide a critical analysis of persuasive sustainability research from 2009-2011.

They also differed in shape geometry as measured by, for example, aperture of closed gestures, corner shape distance and intersecting points deviation; (2) Pen drawn gestures and finger drawn gestures were similar in several measures including articulation time, indicative angle difference, axial symmetry and proportional shape distance; (3) There were interaction effects between gesture implement (finger vs. pen) and target gesture size and gesture complexity.

However, the conventional visual representations that are incorporated in many learning technologies tend to direct learners to overestimate the sizes of imperceptible objects.

In this paper, we report results from an empirical study of human visual attention, specifically the Change Blindness phenomenon, on handheld mobile devices and its impact on mobile UI design. It is arguable that due to the small size of the screen - unlike a typical computer monitor - a greater visual coverage of the mobile device is possible, and that these phenomena may occur less frequently during the use of the device, or even that they may not occur at all. Our study shows otherwise.\nWe tested for Change Blindness (CB) and Inattentional Blindness (IB) in a single-modal, mobile context and attempted to establish factors in the application interface design that induce and/or reduce their occurrences. The results show that both CB and IB can and do occur while using mobile devices. The results also suggest that the number of separate attendable items on-screen is directly proportional to rates of CB.

We investigate the potential of communitysourcing by designing, implementing and evaluating Umati: the communitysourcing vending machine. Umati allows users to earn credits by performing tasks using a touchscreen attached to the machine. Physical rewards (in this case, snacks) are dispensed through traditional vending mechanics. We evaluated whether communitysourcing can accomplish expert work by using Umati to grade Computer Science exams. We placed Umati in a university Computer Science building, targeting students with grading tasks for snacks. Over one week, 328 unique users (302 of whom were students) completed 7771 tasks (7240 by students). 80% of users had never participated in a crowdsourcing market before. We found that Umati was able to grade exams with 2% higher accuracy (at the same price) or at 33% lower cost (at equivalent accuracy) than traditional single-expert grading. Mechanical Turk workers had no success grading the same exams.

We demonstrate that by increasing information access cost, individuals are less likely to omit a required task step. This is because they adopt a more memory-intensive strategy, which encourages interleaving at natural boundaries, i.e., after completing the programming of one of the pumps. Interleaving during programming can result in task steps being forgotten.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2208289&ftid=1217202&dwn=1&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2207676.2208289", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2208289&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81328487836&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "name": "Duncan Brumby"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Visualization + visual analysis", "doi": "10.1145/2207676.2208291", "title": "Analysis within and between graphs: observed user strategies in immunobiology visualization", "abstract": "We present an analysis of two user strategies in interactive data analysis, based on an observational study of four researchers in the immunology domain.

We iteratively refine and expand these sets, concluding with ideas gathered from a panel of designers. Our final step was to make use of thousands of human judgments, gathered in a crowd-sourced fashion (265 participants), to measure the suitability of different expressive forms for conveying different information content.

We raise implications for technologies to support DJs, while also shedding light on previous studies of music consumption and sharing in other settings.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2208314&ftid=1217230&dwn=1&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2207676.2208314", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2208314&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81100143427&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "name": "Andy Crabtree"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Music", "doi": "10.1145/2207676.2208315", "title": "Becoming-sound: affect and assemblage in improvisational digital music making", "abstract": "The concepts of \n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2208315&ftid=1217231&dwn=1&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2207676.2208315", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2208315&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81342513190&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "name": "Benjamin Swift"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Music", "doi": "10.1145/2207676.2208316", "title": "Interactive paper substrates to support musical creation", "abstract": "We present paper substrates, interactive paper components that support the creation and manipulation of complex musical data.

Typical examples include manipulating geometrical shapes in a vector graphics editor, navigating a document using a scrollbar, or moving and resizing windows on the desktop.

We argue that proper and consistent mechanisms to support undo in this context are lacking, and present Dwell-and-Spring, an interaction technique that uses the metaphor of springs to enable users to undo direct manipulations.

Common approaches to authenticate a user on a mobile phone are based either on entering a PIN, a password, or drawing a pattern. However, these authentication methods are vulnerable to the shoulder surfing attack. The risk of this attack has increased since means for recording high-resolution videos are cheaply and widely accessible. If the attacker can videotape the authentication process, PINs, passwords, and patterns do not even provide the most basic level of security. In this project, we assessed the vulnerability of a magnetic gestural authentication method to the video-based shoulder surfing attack. We chose a scenario that is favourable to the attack-er. In a real world environment, we videotaped the interactions of four users performing magnetic signatures on a phone, in the presence of HD cameras from four different angles. We then recruited 22 participants and asked them to watch the videos and try to forge the signatures. The results revealed that with a certain threshold, i.e, th=1.67, none of the forging attacks was successful, whereas at this level all eligible login attempts were successfully recognized. The qualitative feedback also indicated that users found the magnetic gestural signature authentication method to be more secure than PIN-based and 2D signature methods.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2208352&ftid=1217120&dwn=1&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2207676.2208352", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2208352&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81100588072&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "name": "Albrecht Schmidt"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Teaching with games", "doi": "10.1145/2207676.2208354", "title": "Reducing compensatory motions in video games for stroke rehabilitation", "abstract": "Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability among adults in industrialized nations; approximately 80% of people who survive a stroke experience motor disabilities.

In this paper, we introduce Voice Typing, a new speech interaction model where users' utterances are transcribed as they produce them to enable real-time error identification.

Tools intended to improve color differentiability (recoloring tools) exist, but these all use abstract models of only a few types of congenital CVD; if the user's color problems have a different cause, existing recolorers can perform poorly. We have developed a recoloring tool (SSMRecolor) based on the idea of situation-specific modeling -- in which we build a performance-based model of a particular user in their specific environment, and use that model to drive the recoloring process. SSMRecolor covers a much wider range of CVDs, including acquired and situational deficiencies. We evaluated SSMRecolor and two existing tools in a controlled study of people's color-matching performance in several environmental conditions. The study included participants with and without congenital CVD. Our results show both accuracy and response time in color-matching tasks were significantly better with SSMRecolor.

Results based on 6,603,659 keystrokes and 13,013 installations show that visualizing the touched positions using a simple dot decreases the error rate of the Android keyboard by 18.3% but also decreases the speed by 5.2% with no positive effect on learnability.

The paper describes the optimization process and resulting layouts for a standard trapezoid shaped keyboard and a more rectangular layout. Fitts' law modelling shows a predicted 11% improvement in entry speed without taking into account the significantly improved error correction potential and the subsequent effect on speed.

We asked 22 participants to input text under three mobility conditions (seated, slow walking, and normal walking) and three hand conditions (one-hand/portrait, two-hand/portrait, and two-hand/landscape).

We confirm the claim that Twitter broke the news first, and find evidence that Twitter had convinced a large number of its audience before mainstream media confirmed the news. We also discover that attention on Twitter was highly concentrated on a small number of \"opinion leaders\" and identify three groups of opinion leaders who played key roles in spreading the news: individuals affiliated with media played a large part in breaking the news, mass media brought the news to a wider audience and provided eager Twitter users with content on external sites, and celebrities helped to spread the news and stimulate conversation.

In the case of television shows or live sporting events, for example, tweets about them may reveal spoilers to users in different time zones or who are delaying their viewing until later. More broadly, because Twitter is a broadcast medium, users may often want to temporarily or permanently hide content about a very specific given topic.\nIn this paper, we describe the unique challenges to HCI, social computing, and computational linguistics posed by the task of building an interface that blocks all tweets about a specific event or topic. We illustrate some of the challenges through a pilot experiment run for three major television events: the 2009 NFC Championship football game, the 2010 mid-season finale of the show Glee, and the 2010 season premiere of the show 24.

As the number of custom gestures grows it becomes increasingly difficult to 1) know if new gestures will conflict with existing gestures, and 2) know how to extend existing code to reliably recognize the complete gesture set. Proton is a novel framework that addresses both of these problems. Using Proton, the application developer declaratively specifies each gesture as a regular expression over a stream of touch events. Proton statically analyzes the set of gestures to report conflicts, and it automatically creates gesture recognizers for the entire set. To simplify the creation of complex multitouch gestures, Proton introduces gesture tablature, a graphical notation that concisely describes the sequencing of multiple interleaved touch actions over time.

In this paper, we present Gesture Marks, a novel approach to touch-gesture interaction that allows a user to access applications and websites using gestures without having to define them first. It offers two distinctive solutions to address the problem of scalability. First, it leverages the \"wisdom of the crowd\", a continually evolving library of gesture shortcuts that are collected from the user population, to infer the meaning of gestures that a user never defined himself. Second, it combines an extensible template-based gesture recognizer with a specialized handwriting recognizer to even better address handwriting-based gestures, which are a common form of gesture shortcut. These approaches effectively bootstrap a user's personal gesture library, alleviating the need to define most gestures manually. Our work was motivated and validated via a series of user studies, and the findings from these studies add to the body of knowledge on gesture-based interaction.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2208695&ftid=1217407&dwn=1&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2207676.2208695", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2208695&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81350580013&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "name": "Yang Li"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Crowdsourcing & peer production II", "doi": "10.1145/2207676.2208697", "title": "Habit as an explanation of participation in an online peer-production community", "abstract": "User activities in peer-production communities have mainly been examined under the assumption that individuals are rational individuals who are always cognizant of what they are doing and why.

Among US Turkers, we find that social desirability encourages over-reporting of each of four motivating factors we examined. The over-reporting was particularly large in the case of money as a motivator.

These mobile Q&A services are very different from traditional Q&A sites in that questions/answers are short in length and are exchanged via mobile devices (e.g., SMS or mobile Internet). While traditional Q&A sites have been well investigated, so far little is known about the mobile Q&A usage. To understand mobile Q&A usage, we analyzed 2.4 million question/answer pairs spanning a 14 month period from Naver Mobile Q&A and performed a complementary survey study of 555 active mobile Q&A users. We find that mobile Q&A is deeply wired into users' everyday life activities - its usage is largely dependent on users' spatial, temporal, and social contexts; the key factors of mobile Q&A usage are accessibility/convenience of mobile Q&A, promptness of receiving answers, and users' satisficing behavior of information seeking (i.e., minimizing efforts and settling with good enough information). We also observe that users tend to seek more factual information attributed to everyday life activities than they do on traditional Q&A sites and that they exhibit unique interaction patterns such as repeating and refining questions as coping strategies in seeking information needs. Our main findings reported in the paper have significant implications on the design of mobile Q&A systems.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2208741&ftid=1217453&dwn=1&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2207676.2208741", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2208741&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81100226518&CFID=338110234&CFTOKEN=83392360", "name": "Jussi Kantola"}], "pdf": "PDF"}], "year": "CHI%", "confName": "Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems"},

Users have scarce information about who actually sees their content, making their audience seem invisible and difficult to estimate. However, understanding this invisible audience can impact both science and design, since perceived audiences influence content production and self-presentation online. In this paper, we combine survey and large-scale log data to examine how well users' perceptions of their audience match their actual audience on Facebook. We find that social media users consistently underestimate their audience size for their posts, guessing that their audience is just 27% of its true size. Qualitative coding of survey responses reveals folk theories that attempt to reverse-engineer audience size using feedback and friend count, though none of these approaches are particularly accurate. We analyze audience logs for 222,000 Facebook users' posts over the course of one month and find that publicly visible signals --- friend count, likes, and comments --- vary widely and do not strongly indicate the audience of a single post. Despite the variation, users typically reach 61% of their friends each month.

We found that human adaptation covered a variety of VDs --- up to 55 mm in the X, Y direction; up to 125mm in the Z direction; and up to 140mm of interocular distance (IOD). In addition, we found that partial adaptation gave participants the interesting experience of a sense of body structure distortion for a few minutes.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2470698&ftid=1367102&dwn=1&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2470654.2470698", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2470698&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81317499119&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "name": "Ji-Hyung Park"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Papers: technologies for life 1", "doi": "10.1145/2470654.2470700", "title": "Digital motherhood: how does technology help new mothers?", "abstract": "New mothers can experience social exclusion, particularly during the early weeks when infants are solely dependent on their mothers.

While functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a practical brain sensing technology in HCI, visual tasks often rely on the brain's quick, massively parallel visual system, which may be inaccessible to this measurement.

This paper provides an in-depth exploration of labor dynamics in mobile task markets based on a year-long dataset from a leading mobile crowdsourcing platform.

We apply self-determination theory (specifically satisfaction of needs and self-discrepancy represented using the five factors model of personality) to explain PX in an experiment with controller type as the manipulation. Our study shows that there are a number of effects of controller on PX and in-game player personality.

This paper demonstrates how digital volunteers, through activities such as relaying, amplifying, verifying, and structuring information, function as a collectively intelligent cognitive system in the wake of disaster events.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2470769&ftid=1367159&dwn=1&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2470654.2470769", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2470769&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81456637076&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "name": "Kate Starbird"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Papers: crowds and activism", "doi": "10.1145/2470654.2470770", "title": "Does slacktivism hurt activism?: the effects of moral balancing and consistency in online activism", "abstract": "In this paper we explore how the decision of partaking in low-cost, low-risk online activism - slacktivism - \\'14may affect subsequent civic action.

Based on preliminary findings that identified a novel digital ideation paradigm we refer to as chainstorming, or online communication brainstorming, two exploratory studies were performed. First, we developed and tested a distributed method of ideation we call cheatstorming, in which previously generated brainstorm ideas are delivered to targeted local contexts in response to a prompt. We then performed a more rigorous case study to examine the cheatstorming method and consider its possible implementation in the context of a distributed online ideation tool. Based on observations from these studies, we conclude with the somewhat provocative suggestion that ideation need not require the generation of new ideas. Rather, we present a model of ideation suggesting that its value has less to do with the generation of novel ideas than the cultural influence exerted by unconventional ideas on the ideating team. Thus brainstorming is more than the pooling of \"invented\" ideas, it involves the sharing and interpretation of concepts in unintended and (ideally) unanticipated ways.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2466177&ftid=1366823&dwn=1&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2470654.2466177", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2466177&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81361595438&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "name": "Evan Sheehan"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Papers: ideation methods", "doi": "10.1145/2470654.2466178", "title": "Fashionable shape switching: explorations in outfit-centric design", "abstract": "We present a design exercise illustrating how fashion practices and the fashion design process can be used to create new opportunities both in the mobile domain and in product design, as well as in wearable computing.

This leads to a novel architectural arrangement of the home network infrastructure: the network is dynamically re-configured to accept each pre-configured device, rather than the current norm where each device is configured to be acceptable to the pre-configured network. Assuming devices are pre-configured for a unique, device-specific network name and passphrase, MultiNet constructs an out-of-band visual channel via an intermediary network controller device to convey the device's configuration to the network.

After a month of use by three couples, we found unexpected roles of touch in that it supported the couples in developing and sharing their tactile vocabularies by applying POKE during various conversational situations. Moreover, the findings confirmed the roles that touch play in face-to-face communication. In particular, POKE was useful for expressing and understanding emotions, resolving conversations smoothly by replacing the words, feeling close to the partner at a distance, and concentrating on the phone conversations.

We categorise existing literature using our scheme, and explain how researchers could use our framework to classify their future user trials to determine ethical responsibility, and the steps required to meet these obligations.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2466245&ftid=1366878&dwn=1&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2470654.2466245", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2466245&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81100086432&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "name": "Matthew Chalmers"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Papers: ethics in HCI", "doi": "10.1145/2470654.2466246", "title": "Benevolent deception in human computer interaction", "abstract": "Though it has been asserted that \"good design is honest\", [42] deception exists throughout human-computer interaction research and practice.

The input type and the resulting embodiment dramatically influence tabletop interaction: in particular, the touch avoidance that naturally governs people's touching and crossing behavior with physical arms is lost with digital embodiments. One result of this loss is that people are less aware of each others' arms, and less able to coordinate actions and protect personal territories. To determine whether there are strategies that can influence group interaction on shared digital tabletops, we studied augmented digital arm embodiments that provide tactile feedback or movement alterations when people touched or crossed arms. The study showed that both augmentation types changed people's behavior (people crossed less than half as often) and also changed their perception (people felt more aware of the other person's arm, and felt more awkward when touching).

We propose a new account of coherence in a mixed interaction system that integrates externalization mechanisms. We found that physical objects play two roles: they act both as representation of mental objects and as tangible artifacts for interacting with augmented features. We observed that virtual objects represent physical ones, and not the reverse, and, being virtual representations of physical objects, should seamlessly converge with the cognitive role of the physical object.

However, it lacks the ability to alter the pitch of a note after it has been played, a limitation which prevents the performer from executing common expressive techniques including vibrato and pitch bending. We present a system for controlling pitch from the keyboard surface using capacitive touch sensors to measure the locations of the player's fingers on the keys. The large community of trained pianists makes the keyboard a compelling target for augmentation, but it also poses a challenge: how can a musical interface be extended while making use of the existing techniques performers have spent thousands of hours learning? In this paper, user studies with conservatory pianists explore the constraints of traditional keyboard technique and evaluate the usability of the continuous pitch control system. The paper also discusses implications for the extension of other established interfaces in musical and non-musical contexts.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2481302&ftid=1368385&dwn=1&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2470654.2481302", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2481302&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81335497880&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "name": "Adam M.

While the scope of temporal query is very broad, this work focuses on two particularly complex and critical facets of temporal event sequences: intervals (events with both a start time and an end time), and the absence of an event. We describe how users encounter a common set of difficulties when specifying such queries, and propose solutions to help overcome them. Finally, we report on two case studies with epidemiologists at the US Army Pharmacovigilance Center, illustrating how both query interfaces were used to study patterns of drug use.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2481325&ftid=1368406&dwn=1&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2470654.2481325", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2481325&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81557696656&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "name": "Jeff Millstein"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Papers: data navigation", "doi": "10.1145/2470654.2481326", "title": "Beyond the filter bubble: interactive effects of perceived threat and topic involvement on selective exposure to information", "abstract": "We investigated participants' preferential selection of information and their attitude moderation in an online environment.

Participants had a higher tendency to select peer user opinions in topics that they had low than high involvement, but only when there was no perception of threat. Overall, participants' attitudes were moderated after being exposed to diverse views, although high topic involvement led to higher resistance to such moderation.

In safety-critical environments such as air traffic control or on hospital wards, incorrect number entry can have serious harmful consequences. Research has investigated how interface designs can help prevent users from making number entry errors. In this paper, we present an experimental evaluation of two possible interface designs aimed at helping users detect number entry errors using the idea of a checksum: an additional (redundant) number that is related to the to-be-entered numbers in such a way that it is sufficient to verify the correctness of the checksum, as opposed to checking each of the entered numbers. The first interface requires users to check their own work with the help of the checksum; the second requires the user to enter the checksum along with the other numbers so that the system can do the checking. In each case, two numbers needed to be entered, while the third number served as a checksum. With the first interface, users caught only 36% of their errors. The second interface resulted in all errors being caught, but the need to enter the checksum increased entry time by 46%. When participants were allowed to choose between the two interfaces, they chose the second interface in only 12% of the cases. Although these results cannot be generalized to other specific contexts, the results illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each way of using checksums to catch number entry errors. Hence our study can serve as a starting point for efforts to improve each method.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2481332&ftid=1368412&dwn=1&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2470654.2481332", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2481332&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81558118856&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "name": "Sarah O'Carroll"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Papers: social tagging", "doi": "10.1145/2470654.2481334", "title": "All the news that's fit to read: a study of social annotations for news reading", "abstract": "As news reading becomes more social, how do different types of annotations affect people's selection of news articles?

The second experiment simulates a logged-in experience with annotations from friends, finding that friend annotations are both persuasive and improve user satisfaction over their article selections.

As an attempt to resolve these weaknesses, we conducted a large-scale survey of 642 gamers' eating habits and their associated determinants of healthy behavior to understand how health behavior relates to gamer type. We developed seven different models of healthy eating behavior for the gamer types identified by BrainHex.

We consider three factors that are often studied in desktop settings the ad's level of personal relevance to the user, its relevance to the page content, and within-ad properties, with a particular focus on the level of animation in the ad. Our findings reveal a few surprises. First, personal relevance to the user has little or no impact on ad efficacy measured by recall. Instead, content relevance boosts ad recall. Second, user relevance leads to a more pleasant and interesting experience, but content relevance has no effect. Third, contrary to the popular notion that animation often leads to more effective ads by garnering more user attention, we find that a simple type of animation, such as blinking animation, negatively affects user experience and reduces ad recall.

The key idea behind LaserOrigami is that it achieves three-dimensionality by folding and stretching the workpiece, rather than by placing joints, thereby eliminating the need for manual assembly. LaserOrigami achieves this by heating up selected regions of the workpiece until they become compliant and bend down under the force of gravity. LaserOrigami administers the heat by defocusing the laser, which distributes the laser's power across a larger surface. LaserOrigami implements cutting and bending in a single integrated process by automatically moving the cutting table up and down--when users take out the workpiece, it is already fully assembled.

In contrast, augmenting on-screen visualizations with stereoscopic rendering alone or with prop-based manipulation was of limited help.

Spatial consistency allows users to develop memory of object locations, reducing the time needed for visual search, and because spatial memory is long lasting and has a large capacity these performance benefits are enduring and scalable. This suggests that spatial consistency could be used as a fundamental principle for the design of interfaces. However, there are many display situations where the standard presentation is altered in some way: e.g., a window is moved to a new location, scaled, or rotated on a mobile or tabletop display. It is not known whether the benefits of spatial organization are robust to these common kinds of view transformation. To assess these effects, we tested user performance with a spatial interface that had been transformed in several ways, including different degrees of translation, rotation, scaling, and perspective change. We found that performance was not strongly affected by the changes, except in the case of large rotations. To demonstrate the value of spatial consistency over existing mechanisms for dealing with view changes, we compared user performance with a spatially-stable presentation (using scaling) with that of a 'reflowing' presentation (widely used in current interfaces). This study showed that spatial stability with scaling dramatically outperforms reflowing. This research provides new evidence of spatial consistency's value in interface design: it is robust to the view transformations that occur in typical environments, and it provides substantial performance advantages over traditional methods.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=2466430&ftid=1367026&dwn=1&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2470654.2466430", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2466430&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81414620309&CFID=338110242&CFTOKEN=94091907", "name": "Sylvain Malacria"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Papers: spatial interfaces", "doi": "10.1145/2470654.2466431", "title": "Canyon: providing location awareness of multiple moving objects in a detail view on large displays", "abstract": "Overview+Detail interfaces can be used to examine the details of complex data while retaining the data's overall context.

There is a need for novel therapies and interventions that can help children with ASDs develop the social skills necessary to live independently. Since the launch of the iPad, there has been a great deal of excitement in the autism community about multitouch tablets and their possible use in interventions. There are hundreds of apps listed as possibly helping children with ASDs, yet there is little empirical evidence that any of them have positive effects. In this paper we present a study on the use of a set of apps from Open Autism Software at an afterschool program for children with ASDs. The apps are designed to naturally encourage positive social interactions through creative, expressive, and collaborative activities. The study compared activities conducted with the apps to similar activities conducted without the apps. We video recorded the activities, and coded children's behavior. We found that during the study children spoke more sentences, had more verbal interactions, and were more physically engaged with the activities when using the apps. We also found that children made more supportive comments during activities conducted with two of the apps.

Well-designed glyphs have several benefits: they (1) require less screen space and layout effort, (2) are easier to understand in the context of the network, (3) can reveal otherwise hidden relationships, and (4) preserve as much underlying information as possible.

This paper proposes that the value of digital objects may inhere less in an object's identity as a particular item and more in the object's ability to provide access to an intellectual work. The work, a familiar concept in information studies and textual studies, designates a general product of intellectual creation that may be instantiated in many versions.

Slow Design is a design philosophy that focuses on promoting well-being for individuals, society, and the natural environment. It encourages people to do things at the right time and at the right speed which helps them to understand and reflect on their actions. Several authors have proposed Slow Design principles and cases have been reported in which these principles were applied in cultural design projects. These applications indicated that Slow Design can indeed have a positive impact on wellbeing. Although promising, this philosophy has not yet been used in the design of mass consumer products.

Two studies are reported on where the conditions for implementing Slow Design are explored. The results led to a revision of the principles for use by product designers. The main finding from the case study is that the Slow Design principles can be used to create more 'mindful' interactions that stimulate positive user involvement.

Using our prototype, that simulates a miniature projection (via a standard video projector), we visually augment paper documents, giving the user immediate access to additional information and computational tools. We also show how virtual ink can be managed in single and multi-user environments to aid collaboration and data management. User evaluation with professional architects indicated promise of our proposed techniques and their potential utility in the paper-intensive domain of architecture.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1518726&ftid=255063&dwn=1&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1518701.1518726", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1518726&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "authors": [], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "New tabletop input and output methods", "doi": "10.1145/1518701.1518727", "title": "To move or not to move: a comparison between steerable versus fixed focus region paradigms in multi-resolution tabletop display systems", "abstract": "Previous studies have outlined the advantages of multi-resolution large-area displays over their fixed-resolution counterparts, however the mobility of the focus region has up until the present time received little attention.

The results indicate that users' trust in other community members, and the community's information sharing norms have a negative impact on community-specific privacy concerns.

The system has two main components-a vibrating 'Haptic Chair' and a computer display of informative visual effects that correspond to features of the music. The Haptic Chair provides sensory input of vibrations via touch. This system was developed based on an initial concept guided by information obtained from a background survey conducted with deaf people from multi-ethnic backgrounds and feedback received from two profoundly deaf musicians. A formal user study with 43 deaf participants suggested that the prototype system enhances the musical experience of a deaf person. All of the users preferred either the Haptic Chair alone (54%) or the Haptic Chair with the visual display (46%). The prototype system, especially the Haptic Chair was so enthusiastically received by our subjects that it is possible this system might significantly change the way the deaf community experiences music.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1518756&ftid=622470&dwn=1&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1518701.1518756", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1518756&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81414594677&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "name": "S H.

SIP demonstrates the potential of computer generated audio and visual feedback to encourage vocalizations of children with ASD.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1518774&ftid=625353&dwn=1&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1518701.1518774", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1518774&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81377592145&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "name": "James Halle"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Learning challenges", "doi": "10.1145/1518701.1518775", "title": "Autism online: a comparison of word usage in bloggers with and without autism spectrum disorders", "abstract": "The Internet has become a place of refuge for individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In particular, weblogs are a popular option for personal expression via the Internet. Perhaps this means of communication is well suited to bypassing deficits in social interaction and communication that characterize ASD. Using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionaries [10], we compared blogs of individuals with ASD to the writing of neurotypical (NT) bloggers. We found that rates of word usage were nearly identical in the two groups with one exception - there was more variation in the use of social words in ASD compared to NT blogs. This similarity in language between ASD and NT authors suggests that communication deficits routinely found in people with ASD may be due to the social context in which their communication skills are tested, and that the affordances of asynchronous computer-mediated communication may offer alternative means of testing and expression.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1518775&ftid=625354&dwn=1&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1518701.1518775", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1518775&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81416602367&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "name": "Daniel N.

We have experimented with GroupMeter - a chat-based system that presents visual feedback on team members' language use. Feedback on proportion of agreement words and overall word count was presented using two different designs.

In this paper it will furthermore become apparent that such diversity can also exist within a single individual, in the sense that different attribute judgments from a subject may reveal different, complementary, views. A Multi-Dimensional Scaling approach that accounts for the diverse views on a set of stimuli is proposed and its added value is illustrated using published data. We will illustrate that the averaging analysis provides insight to only 1/6th of the total number of attributes in the example dataset. The proposed approach accounts for more than double the information obtained from the average model, and provides richer and semantically diverse views on the set of stimuli.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1518801&ftid=625371&dwn=1&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1518701.1518801", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1518801&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81452610719&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "name": "Marc Hassenzahl"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Metrics", "doi": "10.1145/1518701.1518803", "title": "A survey of software learnability: metrics, methodologies and guidelines", "abstract": "It is well-accepted that learnability is an important aspect of usability, yet there is little agreement as to how learnability should be defined, measured, and evaluated.

Using data from three popular Q&A sites, we confirm that humans can reliably distinguish between these conversational questions and other informational questions, and present evidence that conversational questions typically have much lower potential archival value than informational questions.

Musink supports semi-structured, delayed interpretation and serves as a customizable gesture browser, giving composers significant freedom to create their own, individualized composition languages and to experiment with music, on-paper and on-line.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1518827&ftid=625388&dwn=1&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1518701.1518827", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1518827&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81100236706&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "name": "Wendy E.

We have conducted a study of a passive camera device called Sensecam, which previously has been investigated as a memory aid, a combination of life-logging and memory tool and as a resource for digital narratives. We take a creative perspective and show that even if a camera is designed to be forgotten in use (i.e. is worn as a necklace and takes pictures automatically) it can still be part of an engaging or active photographic experience. Because Sensecam is different from film cameras, camera phones and other digital cameras, it involves a different type of photographic experience, for example when moving through different social contexts and how the resulting pictures are appreciated. The findings stem from people who used the camera for a week. This is complemented with reflections from the researcher, who has been using the camera for a month.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1518828&ftid=625389&dwn=1&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1518701.1518828", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1518828&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81100194686&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "name": "Sara Ljungblad"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Art creation", "doi": "10.1145/1518701.1518829", "title": "Urban pixels: painting the city with light", "abstract": "Urban environments are increasingly filled with digital display systems that are inflexible, flat, bounded, high-resolution, and unresponsive.

To ensure that users can understand the feedback the SDK provides them, it is given in terms of the tool currently used. Furthermore, by preventing runtime errors, a user can be sure a program will work correctly if it compiles.

They allow a user to understand why an application is behaving a certain way, and to change its behavior. Because of their importance to end users, they must be addressed at an interface level. However, often the sensors or machine learning systems that users need to understand and control are created long before a specific application is built, or created separately from the application interface. Thus, supporting interface designers in building intelligibility and control into interfaces requires application logic and underlying infrastructure to be exposed in some structured fashion. As context-aware infrastructures do not provide generalized support for this, we extended one such infrastructure with Situations, components that appropriately exposes application logic, and supports debugging and simple intelligibility and control interfaces, while making it easier for an application developer to build context-aware applications and facilitating designer access to application state and behavior. We developed support for interface designers in Visual Basic and Flash. We demonstrate the usefulness of this support through an evaluation of programmers, an evaluation of the usability of the new infrastructure with interface designers, and the augmentation of three common context-aware applications.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1518832&ftid=625768&dwn=1&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1518701.1518832", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1518832&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81100599350&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "name": "Alan Newberger"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Programming tools and architectures", "doi": "10.1145/1518701.1518833", "title": "VIGO: instrumental interaction in multi-surface environments", "abstract": "This paper addresses interaction in multi-surface environments and questions whether the current application-centric approaches to user interfaces are adequate in this context, and presents an alternative approach based on instrumental interaction.

The findings from our case studies provide evidence of how we can mature the VSD methodology to mitigate the pitfalls of classification and engender a commitment to reflect on and respond to local contexts of design.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1518875&ftid=625703&dwn=1&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1518701.1518875", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1518875&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81314492849&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "name": "Susan P.

In this paper, we report on a study investigating these issues through a questionnaire administered to more than a hundred users of three virtual worlds offering widely different avatar creation and customization systems (Maple Story, World of Warcraft, and Second Life).

One of the biggest issues, certainly for those with no HCI or usability experience, is a lack of appreciation of how users think and work. Their assumption is that users will approach and solve problems in the same way as the designers and developers of an interactive solution. Extreme examples of this self-as-user outlook is the belief that interaction problems are either the direct fault of users or the failure of users to follow instructions (the 'RTFM' syndrome [9]).\nThis paper explores a psychological explanation of the self-as-user outlook through Empathizing-Systemizing theory, including a large-scale study (n = 441) of men and women working in the Information Technology field. The study found that men whose role was technological had significantly lower empathizing scores. The results of the study help to explain the self-as-user outlook and how it needs to be overcome in the design process.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1518901&ftid=625721&dwn=1&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1518701.1518901", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1518901&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81100570773&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "name": "William Hudson"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Cognitive modeling and assessment", "doi": "10.1145/1518701.1518903", "title": "An intuitive model of perceptual grouping for HCI design", "abstract": "Understanding and exploiting the abilities of the human visual system is an important part of the design of usable user interfaces and information visualizations.

Our method, called the Angle Mouse, adjusts the mouse C-D gain based on the deviation of angles sampled during movement. When angular deviation is low, the gain is kept high. When angular deviation is high, the gain is dropped, making the target bigger in motor-space. A key feature of the Angle Mouse is that, unlike most pointing facilitation techniques, it is target-agnostic, requiring no knowledge of target locations or dimensions. This means that the problem of distractor targets is avoided because adaptation is based solely on the user's behavior. In a study of 16 people, 8 of which had motor impairments, we found that the Angle Mouse improved motor-impaired pointing throughput by 10.3% over the Windows default mouse and 11.0% over sticky icons. For able-bodied users, there was no significant difference among the three techniques, as Angle Mouse throughput was within 1.2% of the default.

This suggests that the dependencies of tasks in Wikipedia may determine whether they benefit from increasing the number of editors involved. Specifically, we hypothesize that adding editors may benefit low-coordination tasks but have negative consequences for tasks requiring a high degree of coordination. Furthermore, concentrating the work to reduce coordination dependencies should enable more efficient work by many editors.

A study was conducted in which participants drove a simulated vehicle and occasionally dialed a telephone number on a mobile phone. Experimental instructions and feedback encouraged participants to focus on either driving or dialing. Results show that participants adapted their task interleaving strategies to meet the required task objective, but in a manner that was nonetheless intricately shaped by internal psychological constraints. In particular, participants tended to steer in between dialing chunks of digits even when extreme vehicle drift implied that more reactive strategies would have generated better lane keeping. To better understand why drivers interleaved tasks at chunk boundaries, a modeling analysis was conducted to derive performance predictions for a range of dialing strategies. The analysis supported the idea that interleaving at chunk boundaries efficiently traded the time given up to dialing with the maintenance of a central lane position. We discuss the implications of this work in terms of contributions to understanding how cognitive constraints shape strategy adaptations in dynamic multitask environments.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1518950&ftid=625755&dwn=1&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1518701.1518950", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1518950&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81100489674&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "name": "Andrew Howes"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Studying cell phone use", "doi": "10.1145/1518701.1518951", "title": "At home and with computer access: why and where people use cell phones to access the internet", "abstract": "We conducted a diary and interview study to investigate where and why people use cell phones to access the Internet.

We describe an evaluation of CoSense, reflecting on how its features supported different aspects of sensemaking, and how future collaborative search systems can benefit from these findings.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1518974&ftid=625774&dwn=1&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1518701.1518974", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1518974&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "authors": [], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Social search and sensemaking", "doi": "10.1145/1518701.1518975", "title": "PlayByPlay: collaborative web browsing for desktop and mobile devices", "abstract": "Collaborative web browsing tasks occur frequently, such as one user showing another how to use a web site, several users working together on a search task, or even one user sending an interesting link to another user.

This reduced awareness results in impoverished coordination; for example, the number of conflicts might increase since users are more likely to interact with objects that another person is planning to use. Conflicts may also arise because indirect techniques reduce territorial behavior, expanding the interaction space of each collaborator. In this paper, we introduce three new tabletop coordination techniques designed to reduce conflicts arising from indirect input, while still allowing users the flexibility of distant object control. Two techniques were designed to promote territoriality and to allow users to protect objects when they work near their personal areas, and the third technique lets users set their protection levels dynamically. We present the results of an evaluation, which shows that people prefer techniques that automatically provide protection for personal territories, and that these techniques also increase territorial behavior.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1519025&ftid=626104&dwn=1&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1518701.1519025", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1519025&CFID=338110245&CFTOKEN=18128952", "authors": [], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Tabletops and single display groupware", "doi": "10.1145/1518701.1519026", "title": "Territorial coordination and workspace awareness in remote tabletop collaboration", "abstract": "There is growing interest in tabletop interfaces that enable remote collaboration by providing shared workspaces.

Game players may lose interests if a game is either too easy or too difficult. This paper presents a novel methodology to improve user's experience in computer games by automatically adjusting the level of the game difficulty. The difficulty level is computed from measurements of the facial physiology of the players at a distance. The measurements are based on the assumption that the players' performance during the game-playing session alters blood flow in the supraorbital region, which is an indirect measurement of increased mental activities. This alters heat dissipation, which can be monitored in a contact-free manner through a thermal imaging-based stress monitoring and analysis system, known as StressCam.\nIn this work, we investigated on two primary objectives: (1) the feasibility of utilizing the facial physiology in automatically adjusting the difficulty level of the game and (2) the capability of the automatic difficulty level adjustment in improving game players' experience. We employed and extended a XNA video game for this study, and performed an in-depth, comparative usability evaluation on it. Our results show that the automatic difficulty adjustable system successfully maintains game players' interests and substantially outperforms traditional fixed-difficulty mode games.

'Empty moments' provide a compelling new opportunity for design, requiring subtlety and flexibility to enable participants to share connection without explicit messages. We designed MissU as a technology probe to study empty moments in situ. Similar to a private radio station, MissU shares music and background sounds.

Analysis showed that 94% of the time, users switched to the interrupting task during periods of lower workload, versus only 6% during periods of higher workload.

Based on the extracted logic, FrameWire offers two distinct benefits for designers: a structural view of the video recording that allows a designer or a stakeholder to easily distill and understand the design concept and user interaction behaviors, and automatic generation of interactive HTML-based prototypes that can be easily tested with a larger group of users as well as \"walked through\" by other stakeholders.

This design crosses the boundaries between leisure and work, in ways that are different from what is often seen in current HCI. The timeline has several roles on these boundaries: It is a shared planning and visualization tool that may be used by parents and caseworkers alone or together, it serves as a contract and a sandbox, as a record and a plan, as inspiration for planning and an authoritative road, as a common information space and a fragmented exchange.

We derived a stage-based model of personal informatics systems composed of five stages (preparation, collection, integration, reflection, and action) and identified barriers in each of the stages. These stages have four essential properties: barriers cascade to later stages; they are iterative; they are user-driven and/or system-driven; and they are uni-faceted or multi-faceted.

In this paper, we show that this is not the case. We base our argument on a new model of touch inaccuracy. Our model is not based on the fat finger problem, but on the perceived input point model. In its published form, this model states that touch screens report touch location at an offset from the intended target. We generalize this model so that it represents offsets for individual finger postures and users. We thereby switch from the traditional 2D model of touch to a model that considers touch a phenomenon in 3-space. We report a user study, in which the generalized model explained 67% of the touch inaccuracy that was previously attributed to the fat finger problem.\nIn the second half of this paper, we present two devices that exploit the new model in order to improve touch accuracy. Both model touch on per-posture and per-user basis in order to increase accuracy by applying respective offsets. Our RidgePad prototype extracts posture and user ID from the user's fingerprint during each touch interaction. In a user study, it achieved 1.8 times higher accuracy than a simulated capacitive baseline condition. A prototype based on optical tracking achieved even 3.3 times higher accuracy.

This multi-layer approach brings in several novel painting operations that contribute to a more compelling WYSIWYG 3D painting interface; this is particular useful when dealing with complicated objects with occluded parts and objects that cannot be easily parameterized.

We find that increased diversity in experience with Wikipedia increases group productivity and decreases member withdrawal -- up to a point. Beyond that point, group productivity remains high, but members are more likely to withdraw. Strikingly, no such diminishing returns were observed for differences in member interest, which increases productivity and decreases member withdrawal in a linear fashion.

In our new system a multi-touch table senses objects placed upon its surface and the system can highlight the objects on the table by flashing an area of light around them. This allows us to construct a P300-based BCI that uses a user-assembled collection of objects as targets, rather than a pre-determined grid layout.

In addition, we highlight implications that inform the design of social games with a purpose.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1753473&ftid=769980&dwn=1&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1753326.1753473", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1753473&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81100082450&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "name": "Nuria Oliver"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Tagging", "doi": "10.1145/1753326.1753474", "title": "Some observations on the \"live\" collaborative tagging of audio conferences in the enterprise", "abstract": "This paper describes preliminary findings related to a system for \"live\" collaborative tagging of enterprise meetings taking place on an audio bridge between distributed participants.

Pointing gestures can be complex and subtle, however, and pointing is much more difficult in the virtual world. In order to improve the richness of interaction in CVEs, it is important to provide better support for pointing and deictic reference, and a first step in this support is to determine how well people can interpret the direction that another person is pointing. To investigate this question, we carried out two studies. The first identified several ways that people point towards distant targets, and established that not all pointing requires high accuracy. This suggested that natural CVE pointing could potentially be successful; but no knowledge is available about whether even moderate accuracy is possible in CVEs. Therefore, our second study looked more closely at how accurately people can produce and interpret the direction of pointing gestures in CVEs. We found that although people are more accurate in the real world, the differences are smaller than expected; our results show that deixis can be successful in CVEs for many pointing situations, and provide a foundation for more comprehensive support of deictic pointing.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1753480&ftid=769985&dwn=1&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1753326.1753480", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1753480&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81100275704&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "name": "Carl Gutwin"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Avatars and virtual environments", "doi": "10.1145/1753326.1753481", "title": "Lie tracking: social presence, truth and deception in avatar-mediated telecommunication", "abstract": "The success of visual telecommunication systems depends on their ability to transmit and display users' natural nonverbal behavior.

Reading speed and accuracy were measured and subjective views of participants recorded.\nResults showed that: (a) there was little difference in reading performance for the video and 3D backgrounds; (b) the negative presentation outperformed the positive presentation; (c) the billboard drawing styles supported the best performance; subjective comments showed a preference for the billboard style.

Various derivatives describe unimodal and bimodal effects. Results from a case study (mobile text entry) illustrate how an interface that is superior to others in absolute terms is the worst from the multimodal flexibility perspective. We discuss the suitability of MFI for evaluation of interactive prototypes.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1753547&ftid=797652&dwn=1&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1753326.1753547", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1753547&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81453655512&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "name": "Joanna Bergstrom-Lehtovirta"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Humans and sociability", "doi": "10.1145/1753326.1753548", "mp4Href": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1753548&ftid=771265&dwn=1&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "title": "Social gravity: a virtual elastic tether for casual, privacy-preserving pedestrian rendezvous", "abstract": "We describe a virtual \"tether\" for mobile devices that allows groups to have quick, simple and privacy-preserving meetups.

The Social Gravity system makes social bonds tangible in a virtual world which is geographically grounded, using haptic feedback to help users rendezvous. We show dynamic navigation using this physical model-based system to be efficient and robust in significant field trials, even in the presence of low-quality positioning. The use of simulators to build models of mobile geolocated systems for pre-validation purposes is discussed, and results compared with those from our trials.

With large or multiple visual displays we have many tasks where both attention areas are on the screen and where using a finger as a placeholder is not suitable. One way users deal with this is to use the mouse and highlight their current focus. However, this also has its limitations -- in particular in environments where there is no pointing device. Our approach is to utilize the user's gaze position to provide a visual placeholder. The last area where a user fixated on the screen (before moving their attention away) is highlighted; we call this visual reminder a Gazemark. Gazemarks ease orientation and the resumption of the interrupted task when coming back to this display.

SensorTune uses non-speech audio to present to its users information regarding the connectivity of the network they are setting up, allowing them to decide how to extend it. To simplify the interpretation of the data presented, the system adopts the metaphor of tuning a consumer analog radio, a very common and well known operation. A user study was conducted in which 20 subjects setup real multi-hop networks inside a large building using a limited number of wireless nodes.

To improve the specificity and accuracy of these approaches, we have developed the first ever individualized model of color differentiation (ICD).

We illustrate aspects of this relationship using findings from a deployment of an interactive tabletop in a public setting.

The basic idea is that users can exert closed-loop control over several continuous variables by voluntarily modulating the parameters of a sustained oscillation. Touch-sensitive surfaces tend to offer impoverished input resources. Cyclo* techniques seem particularly promising on these surfaces because oscillations have multiple geometrical and kinematic parameters many of which may be used as controls.

Direct-touch interaction simplifies object manipulation, because it combines the input and display into a single integrated interface. While traditional tangible display-based direct-touch technology is commonplace, similar direct-touch interaction within an intangible display paradigm presents many challenges. Given the lack of tactile feedback, direct-touch interaction on an intangible display may show poor performance even on the simplest of target acquisition tasks. In order to study this problem, we have created a prototype of an intangible display. In the initial study, we collected user discrepancy data corresponding to the interpretation of 3D location of targets shown on our intangible display. The result showed that participants performed poorly in determining the z-coordinate of the targets and were imprecise in their execution of screen touches within the system. Thirty percent of positioning operations showed errors larger than 30mm from the actual surface. This finding triggered our interest to design a second study, in which we quantified task time in the presence of visual and audio feedback. The pseudo-shadow visual feedback was shown to be helpful both in improving user performance and satisfaction.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1753725&ftid=770030&dwn=1&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1753326.1753725", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1753725&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81100111382&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "name": "Yi-Ping Hung"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Presentations", "doi": "10.1145/1753326.2167153", "title": "Agencies at the Interface: Expanding Frames and Accountable Cuts", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1753326.2167153", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2167153&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "authors": []}, {"session": "Presentations", "doi": "10.1145/1753326.2167154", "title": "The 2010 SIGCHI Social Impact Award", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1753326.2167154", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2167154&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "authors": []}, {"session": "Presentations", "doi": "10.1145/1753326.2167155", "title": "The 2010 SIGCHI Social Impact Award: Q&A", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1753326.2167155", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2167155&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "authors": []}, {"session": "Presentations", "doi": "10.1145/1753326.2167156", "title": "CHI 2010 Welcome", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1753326.2167156", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2167156&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "authors": []}, {"session": "Presentations", "doi": "10.1145/1753326.2167157", "title": "Messy Futures: Culture, Technology and Research", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1753326.2167157", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2167157&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "authors": []}, {"session": "Presentations", "doi": "10.1145/1753326.2167158", "title": "Messy Futures: Culture, Technology and Research: Q&A", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1753326.2167158", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2167158&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "authors": []}, {"session": "Presentations", "doi": "10.1145/1753326.2167159", "title": "Addressing Challenges in Doing International Field Research", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1753326.2167159", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2167159&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "authors": []}, {"session": "Presentations", "doi": "10.1145/1753326.2167160", "title": "CHI Madness: Part 1", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1753326.2167160", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2167160&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "authors": []}, {"session": "Presentations", "doi": "10.1145/1753326.2167161", "title": "Lifetime Practice Award", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1753326.2167161", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2167161&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "authors": []}, {"session": "Presentations", "doi": "10.1145/1753326.2167162", "title": "CHI Madness: Part 2", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1753326.2167162", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2167162&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "authors": []}, {"session": "Presentations", "doi": "10.1145/1753326.2167163", "title": "CHI Madness: Part 3", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1753326.2167163", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2167163&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "authors": []}, {"session": "Presentations", "doi": "10.1145/1753326.2167164", "title": "Invited Design Speaker", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1753326.2167164", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2167164&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "authors": []}, {"session": "Presentations", "doi": "10.1145/1753326.2167165", "title": "Data and Information in the Palm of Our Hands", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1753326.2167165", "href": "citation.cfm?id=2167165&CFID=338110243&CFTOKEN=90023132", "authors": []}], "year": "CHI%", "confName": "Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems"},

There are several reasons for the scarcity of research on gustatory information. One reason is that taste sensations are affected by a number of factors, such as vision, olfaction and memories. This produces a complex cognition mechanism for a user's gustatory sensation, and makes it difficult to build up a gustatory display which produces a specific taste on demand.\nOur hypothesis is that the complexity of gustatory sensation can be applied to the realization of a \"Pseudo-gustatory\" display that presents the desired flavors by means of a cross-modal effect elicited by visual and olfactory augmented reality. We propose the Edible Marker system, which can detect the state [number/shape/6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) coordinate] of each piece of bitten or divided food in real time, and the \"Pseudo-gustation\" method to change the perceived taste of food by changing its appearance and scent.

Building upon empirical data gathered from studies of pan-and-zoom on desktop computers and studies of remote pointing, we identified three key factors for the design of mid-air pan-and-zoom techniques: uni- vs. bimanual interaction, linear vs. circular movements, and level of guidance to accomplish the gestures in mid-air. After an extensive phase of iterative design and pilot testing, we ran a controlled experiment aimed at better understanding the influence of these factors on task performance.

For deminers engaged in humanitarian landmine clearance, metal detectors remain the primary detection tool as more sophisticated technologies fail to get adopted due to restrictive cost, low reliability, and limited robustness. Metal detectors are, however, of limited effectiveness, as modern landmines contain only minimal amounts of metal, making them difficult to distinguish from the ubiquitous but harmless metallic clutter littering post-combat areas. We seek to improve the safety and efficiency of the demining process by developing support tools that will enable deminers to make better decisions using feedback from existing metal detectors. To this end, in this paper we propose and evaluate a novel, pattern-based visual support approach inspired by the documented strategies employed by expert deminers. In our laboratory study, participants provided with a prototype of our support tool were 80% less likely to mistake a mine for harmless clutter. A follow-up study demonstrates the potential of our pattern-based approach to enable peer decision-making support during landmine clearance.

This work provides a tool to researchers in need of frequent assessment of affect and guidance to others interested in developing similar measurement tools.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1979047&ftid=952027&dwn=1&CFID=338110244&CFTOKEN=39323381", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1978942.1979047", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1979047&CFID=338110244&CFTOKEN=39323381", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81367597457&CFID=338110244&CFTOKEN=39323381", "name": "Geri Gay"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Emotional states", "doi": "10.1145/1978942.1979048", "title": "Affective computational priming and creativity", "abstract": "While studies have shown that affect influences creativity, few investigate how affect influences creative performance with creativity support tools.

We demonstrate that it is possible to robustly recognize touched locations on an uninstrumented home wall using no specialized sensors.

We discuss how these routine models give digital calendars, reminder and location systems new capabilities to help prevent breakdowns, and improve family life.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1979119&ftid=964236&dwn=1&CFID=338110244&CFTOKEN=39323381", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1978942.1979119", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1979119&CFID=338110244&CFTOKEN=39323381", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81100327371&CFID=338110244&CFTOKEN=39323381", "name": "Anind K.

While such imagery is already available from many sources, including Street View and tourist photos on photo-sharing sites, these collections have drawbacks related to high cost, incompleteness, and accuracy. A potential solution is to leverage the community of photographers around the world to collaboratively acquire large-scale image collections. This work explores this approach through PhotoCity, an online game that trains its players to become \"experts\" at taking photos at targeted locations and in great density, for the purposes of creating 3D building models. To evaluate our approach, we ran a competition between two universities that resulted in the submission of over 100,000 photos, many of which were highly relevant for the 3D modeling task at hand.

To further understand this impact, we conducted an extended field study across four field sites in India that are rich in folk music tradition and activity. Through a process of interviews, participant observation, focus group discussion, and content analysis with a varied group of stakeholders - including folk musicians, listeners, retailers, and radio show producers - we found that 1) there are a diverse set of motivations for performing and listening to folk music, 2) new media technologies are helping folk musicians become more popular, while reducing some streams of revenue, particularly for businesses engaged only in music production and distribution, and 3) as expected, piracy is widely tolerated by musicians, both out of apathy, and an interest in reaching new audiences with their message, while increasing their own fame and associated patronage.

In this paper we propose a new model for creativity in distributed groups, based on the theory of groups as complex systems, that includes affect as well as cognition and that explicitly calls out the interface between individuals as a key parameter of the model. We describe the model, the four stages of collaborative creativity and the causal dynamics in each stage, and demonstrate how affect and interface can facilitate the generation, selection, and amplification of ideas in the various stages of collaborative creativity. We then validate our model with data from three field sites.

Our research asks a basic question: how well does domain highlighting work? To answer this, we showed 22 participants 16 web pages typical of those targeted for phishing attacks, where participants had to determine the page's legitimacy. In the first round, they judged the page's legitimacy by whatever means they chose. In the second round, they were directed specifically to look at the address bar. We found that participants fell into 3 types in terms of how they determined the legitimacy of a web page; while domain highlighting was somewhat effective for one user type, it was much less effective for others.

The three methodologies were compared with respect to the following dependent variables: the time taken to complete the tasks; the usability defects identified; the severity of these usability defects; and the subjective ratings from NASA-TLX, presence and post-test subjective questionnaires. The three methodologies agreed closely in terms of the total number defects identified, number of high severity defects identified and the time taken to complete the tasks. However, there was a significant difference in the workload experienced by the test participants and facilitators, with the traditional lab condition imposing the least and the virtual lab and the WebEx conditions imposing similar levels. It was also found that the test participants experienced greater involvement and a more immersive experience in the virtual world condition than the WebEx condition.

To solve this problem, we propose the notion of collaboration personas, which are empirically derived descriptions of hypothetical groups, including details that inform the design of collaboration tools. Collaboration personas differ from individual personas in having (1) multiple, inter-related individuals playing specific roles; (2) a focus on collective goals and elaboration of individual goals that affect the collective goal; and (3) new attributes that characterize collaborative aspects of the group's work.

We compared three techniques in a study, and found that area cursors and target gravity significantly reduced score differential in a shooting-gallery game.

Our tool, Data Cracker, was built for monitoring gameplay in Dead Space 2, the latest game in the Dead Space franchise. We use Data Cracker as a case study to inform a larger discussion of designing a visual game analytic tool while working with a game team. Our design approach focuses on increasing the data literacy of a game team. This means getting an entire team interested and involved with game analytics. We found that building our tool during the early game development cycle, creating multiple early visual prototypes and branding the tool to the Dead Space team caused more team members to become interested in our tool. Increasing interest in analytics is also a means, we argue, for changing the common occurrence within the game industry to disband teams after a game is released. Instead, we promote the creation of \"live\" teams which stay attached to a game long after it is release in order to continue the analysis process. Additionally, we discuss the barriers one might face when developing game analytic tools, such as prejudice against analytics or the technical issues involved when collecting large data sets.

We use a Large Area Tactile Pattern Display (LATPaD) to examine design possibilities and outcomes when touch interactions are enhanced with variable surface friction. In a series of four studies, we first confirm that variable friction gives significant performance advantages in low-level targeting activities.

Our results clearly show the limits of traditional target-aware control-display gain adaptation in the latter case, and the benefits of our tactile approach in both cases. Surfpad leads to a performance improvement close to 9% compared to unassisted pointing at small targets with no distractor. It is also robust to high distractor densities, keeping an average performance improvement of nearly 10% while Semantic Pointing can degrade up to 100%.

Findings from our previous work indicate, however, that such devices are subject to systematic error offsets. This suggests that the underlying assumption is most likely wrong. In this paper, we therefore revisit this assumption. In a series of three user studies, we find evidence that the features that users align with the target are visual features. These features are located on the top of the user's fingers, not at the bottom, as assumed by traditional devices. We present the projected center model, under which error offsets drop to 1.6mm, compared to 4mm for the traditional model. This suggests that the new model is indeed a good approximation of how users conceptualize touch input. The primary contribution of this paper is to help understand touch-one of the key input technologies in human-computer interaction. At the same time, our findings inform the design of future touch input technology. They explain the inaccuracy of traditional touch devices as a -Sparallax- artifact between user control based on the top of the finger and sensing based on the bottom side of the finger.

The GPS data is situated and interpreted by the dog handler, and supports the hunter's work of dealing with the dogs' intentions. This opens up for new forms of interactions with the dog. When studying and designing for interaction between humans and animals we should move beyond merely looking at dyadic relationships, and also consider the social organization of the interaction.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1979328&ftid=951971&dwn=1&CFID=338110244&CFTOKEN=39323381", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1978942.1979328", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1979328&CFID=338110244&CFTOKEN=39323381", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81100316356&CFID=338110244&CFTOKEN=39323381", "name": "Oskar Juhlin"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Cats, dogs, sports, games & books", "doi": "10.1145/1978942.1979329", "title": "Communication technology for human-dog interaction: exploration of dog owners' experiences and expectations", "abstract": "Whereas communication technology to connect people has long been an integral part of our everyday lives, it has only recently expanded to offer applications for dogs and dog-owners.

We propose a concrete mapping of vowel-like sounds to radial directions as one potential method to enable sonification of such information.

From these we identify design guidelines that can inform a toolkit approach to support both scalability and personalisability.\n", "pdfHref": "ft_gateway.cfm?id=1979397&ftid=951988&dwn=1&CFID=338110244&CFTOKEN=39323381", "doiHref": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1978942.1979397", "href": "citation.cfm?id=1979397&CFID=338110244&CFTOKEN=39323381", "authors": [{"href": "author_page.cfm?id=81484642518&CFID=338110244&CFTOKEN=39323381", "name": "Jane Burridge"}], "pdf": "PDF"}, {"session": "Rehabilitation", "doi": "10.1145/1978942.1979398", "title": "Group pulmonary rehabilitation delivered to the home via the internet: feasibility and patient perception", "abstract": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common and debilitating lung condition.

In this paper, we used data from five distinct large-scale projects from three different companies to study the scale, range, and volatility of the coordination requirements that emerged over time within those projects. Our results showed that coordination requirements tend to be quite volatile, vary significantly in their magnitude across project members and a significant proportion of the coordination requirements cut across organizational and geographical boundaries.

Understanding how technology use impacts teens' learning, growth, and social development is critical for their health and wellbeing and for the welfare of the family. Yet, balancing parent authority with teen privacy and autonomy is difficult. We conducted an interview study with 16 parents to examine challenges in \"technoparenting\" - parenting teens' technology use. Parents said they wanted more transparency in their teens' use of cell phones and the Internet and they struggled with their own unfamiliarity with technology. Technoparenting is a distributed problem and, surprisingly, parents wanted support and collaboration from the broader community.

Previous research suggests that when handling email, individuals prioritize certain messages for attention over others. Since people generally make this decision about which message to read before opening the email, the question largely unanswered in the email literature is: what surface features of an email draw attention to it? In this research, we examined how top-level cues about an email's content influence attention to email. We describe results from a think-aloud study examining people's stated rationale for prioritizing certain emails over others. Based on these results and theory on curiosity, we conducted an experiment examining how message importance, subject line specificity, workload and personal utility influence attention to email. Results suggest that uncertainty about message content at the inbox level increases the likelihood of attention to a message. The influence of uncertainty diminishes, however, in the face of enhanced task and personal utility cues and increased demand, suggesting that curiosity operates in an intrinsic way in the email context.

To compare these different refinding strategies, we instrumented a modern email client that supports search, folders, tagging and threading. We carried out a field study of 345 long-term users who conducted over 85,000 refinding actions. Our data support opportunistic access. People who create complex folders indeed rely on these for retrieval, but these preparatory behaviors are inefficient and do not improve retrieval success.

These emailed requests can be interpreted by Dandelion and are then used to automatically drive the collaboration flow. As part of its actions, Dandelion automatically creates a wiki page and dynamically updates it to record co-authoring tasks and collate co-authored content. As a result, users can use their familiar tool (email) to accomplish their tasks in a co-authoring process, while leveraging a wiki for additional benefits (e.g., obtaining collaboration awareness and formatting the text).

An online survey of 224 people finds that although phish are detected approximately 80% of the time, those with logos are significantly harder to detect. A qualitative interview study was undertaken to better understand the strategies used to identify phish. Blind users were selected because it was thought they may be more vulnerable to phishing attacks, however they demonstrated robust strategies for identifying phish based on careful reading of emails.
