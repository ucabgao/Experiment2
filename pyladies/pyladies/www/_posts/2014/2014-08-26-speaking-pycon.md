### Choose your own speaking adventure

PyCon offers many opportunities for speaking:

* Formal, traditional spaces:
    - talks (30 minutes, a few 45 minute slots)
    - tutorials (3 hours of interactive teaching)
    - lightning talks (bitesized talks of 5 minutes each)
    - posters (an opportunity to talk one on one with others)
* And the informal spaces:
    - Birds of a Feather sessions (BoFs)
    - sprints
    - open spaces
    - the ever popular hallway track

Whatever you choose, remember "your" Python experiences, whether beginner, advanced or somewhere in between, are valuable. Please consider sharing "your" voice with the community.
