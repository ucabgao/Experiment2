<div class="about">
    <p><b>Yellow Lab Tools</b> is an open source project by <a href="http://www.gaelmetais.com" target="_blank">Gaël Métais</a>. It lets you test a webpage (via an URL) and detects <b>performance</b> and <b>front-end code quality</b> issues.</p>

    <p>This is done by loading the webpage via PhantomJS and collecting various metrics and statistics with the help of <a href="https://github.com/macbre/phantomas" target="_blank">Phantomas</a>. These metrics are categorized and transformed into scores. It also gives in-depth details so developpers can correct the detected issues.</p>

    <p>By the way, <b>it's free</b> because we are geeks, not businessmen. All we want is <a href="https://github.com/gmetais/YellowLabTools" target="_blank" class="star">a <span>&#9733;</span> on GitHub</a>. It will boost our motivation to add more awesome features!!!</p>
